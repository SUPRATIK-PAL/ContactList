# CONTACT LIST APP

The Contact List App is a simple web application built with React that allows users to manage their contacts. It provides features such as fetching and displaying contacts from an API, adding new contacts, updating existing contacts, and deleting contacts.
## Features
---------------------------------------
* Fetches and shows users from the API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users).
* Adds a contact by making a POST call to the API (dummy request).
* Updates a contact by making a PUT call to the API (dummy request).
* Deletes a contact by making a DELETE call to the API (dummy request).
* Provides a separate component for adding a contact.
* Styling using Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing UI.
* Uses gradient backgrounds and color texts to enhance the design.
* Adds shadow effect to list items for a visually appealing layout.
## Usage
---------------------------------------
1. The Contact List App will be displayed with an empty contact list.

1. To add a new contact, fill in the name and email fields in the "Add Contact" form and click the "Add Contact" button. The contact will be added to the list.

1. To update a contact, click the "Edit" button next to the contact you want to update. The contact details will be displayed in editable fields. Modify the name or email, and click the "Save" button to update the contact.

1. To delete a contact, click the "Delete" button next to the contact you want to remove. The contact will be removed from the list.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
